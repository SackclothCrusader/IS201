In general:

    The site must be professional in appearance. One way to do this is using a bootstrap theme (which we recommend). We will deduct points for clear aesthetic errors anywhere on your site that reduce readability or are distracting. These include, but are not limited to:
        Blue text on red background is atrocious
        Animated GIF backgrounds are horrific
        Red text on gray background is impossible to read
        Anything like this: click me if you dare
    The site must be hosted online (e.g., via GitHub pages).
    The site must not have any broken content: images, links, videos, etc., incuding social icon links.
    The site must include a résumé portion created in HTML (not as a PDF). This should be a useful resume with good information organized in an easy-to-access way. Useful information includes your education, work experience, skills, and possibly some awards or honors that distinguish you. You do not need to include your contact information unless you want to. The résumé content can appear in your professional pages or your scratch page, or both.

From-scratch page:

    This page must be created from a blank HTML file.
    It can be about anything. Pick a hobby, or a passion, or something that fascinates you.
    It must include the following as a demonstration of your ability to write HTML and CSS:
        An unordered list embedded in an ordered list (or the other way around)
        At least one image not from the Bootstrap theme (feel free to have many more)
        An embedded YouTube video (we intentionally didn’t teach you this, so you would have to figure it out—good learning experience)
        An on-page anchor
        A custom background color or background image
    You also need to link to (and apply) a stylesheet that you have created from scratch. This stylesheet should include:
        At least four style definitions (it is possible you will have many more than four styles)
        Styles that specify font color
        Styles that specify font family
        At least three divs for positioning and styling blocks of content in the HTML page
    A live and interactive embedded Tableau graph (not just a picture of one).
        This graph can be about anything. It doesn’t have to be a graph you created, although it certainly can be.
        A quick Google search will show you where to find cool Tableau visualizations.
    Navigation back to the professional-looking pages.
        Your professional-looking pages do not need to link to the scratch page (but you will submit the URL to your scratch page). This way you can use the professional side for whatever you want without worrying someone might find this scratch page… 
        If you are a graduate student, you must also include a link on this scratch page to your extra page (see below).

A small web app created in collaboration with AI: 

    Be creative. Here are some examples of what other students have done. Keep in mind that the first three are fairly basic. To merit full credit on an app like one of these first three would require you to creatively contribute (either in style or function) to what the AI comes up with to go beyond a basic app.
        Riddle generator
        Joke generator
        Number guessing game
        Snake game
        Wordle clone
    Try to keep the code for this app in a single page (e.g., styles, HTML, and scripts all on one page).
    This page should be accessible via a link from the scratch page.
    Rarely will the AI get it right on the first attempt. Feel free to iterate and refine with the AI until it meets your expectations. You are also encouraged to edit the AI solution to be just how you want it.
